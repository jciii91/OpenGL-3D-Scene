How do I approach designing software?
 - What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
   - After this project I have become comfortable working with the OpenGL API.
 - What design process did you follow for your project work?
   - I worked on the project in distinct pieces. Each step built on the previous.
 - How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
   - I would approach future projects in the same way. Building it in small pieces that eventually fit together as a whole.

How do I approach developing programs?
 - What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
   - I didn't use any strategies I haven't used before, but I feel like I did improve on my coding practices.
 - How did iteration factor into your development?
   - The entire design process was iterative.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
 - How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
   - At this time I do not plan on using these skills in future classes.
 - How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
   - I do have an interest in working in games, so there could be a scenario in the future where I would need to use the knowledge I have gained.
